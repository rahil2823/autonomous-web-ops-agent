# MakeMyTrip Autonomous Web Operations Agent

A governed browser-agent platform that turns recurring web monitoring (competitor offers, hotell
pricing, campaign pages, partner updates, travel demand signals) into auditable workflows:

**task intake → agent planning → (plan approval) → controlled browser execution → structured
extraction → snapshot comparison → reasoning loop → completion (summary, alerts, export, review)**

> **Deployed application:** `https://mmt-web-ops-agent-g2bj.onrender.com/` (add after deploying; see *Deploy*)
> **Interactive demo (no backend needed):** open `frontend/index.html` directly; it detects that no
> API is reachable and runs the same pipeline in the browser against bundled sample sources.
> **Demonstration video:** `<[Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wTVzG3WtcNB0qbtqcrBbQji7e_KZvcMB/view?usp=sharing), "Anyone with the link can view">.`

## Run it on Windows (10 or 11)

1. Install **Python 3.10 or newer** from python.org. On the first installer screen tick **"Add python.exe to PATH"**.
2. Unzip this folder somewhere without special permissions, e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\web-ops-agent`.
3. Double-click **`setup_windows.bat`**. It creates a virtual environment, installs packages, downloads
   Chromium for the agent, and creates `.env`. Takes a few minutes the first time.
4. Double-click **`start_windows.bat`**. The console opens at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Close that window to stop.

`reset_data_windows.bat` clears run history, snapshots and frames if you want a clean demo.

macOS / Linux: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt &&
python -m playwright install chromium && uvicorn backend.api.main:app --port 8000`.

## Watching the agent work

- **Live browsers** (sidebar) shows every running workflow with its latest browser frame.
- Open a run and the **Live browser** tab streams what Chromium is doing: the page, the URL, an orange
  box around the element the agent is about to click or type into, and a caption of the action. The step
  list on the right ticks off in real time. After the run, drag the slider to replay every frame.
- **Controls**: Pause, Resume, Step one action, Stop run.
- **Run options** (shown when you click Run now / Start): speed (fast, normal, slow), step-through mode,
  and **"Also open a visible Chrome window on this computer"** to watch the real browser window on your
  laptop. Set `BROWSER_HEADED=true` in `.env` to make that the default.
- When a transaction reaches its approval step, an **approval card** appears in the live view and the run
  shows up in the **Review queue**. Approve and the agent continues; decline and it stops before the
  irreversible step.

## Workflow types

| Type | Kind | Demo website | What the agent does in the browser |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flight booking | Transaction | SkyRoam Travel | Types origin/destination/date, searches, filters non-stop, sorts, records fares, picks the cheapest, fills traveller details, unticks pre-ticked insurance, reads the total, **asks you to approve**, confirms and reads the reference |
| Hotel booking | Transaction | SkyRoam Travel | Filters free cancellation, sorts by price, picks the cheapest hotel and then the cheapest room, fills guest details, unticks the airport-pickup add-on, **asks you to approve**, confirms |
| Flight fare search | Monitor | SkyRoam Travel | Fills the search form, applies filters, records every fare, compares with the last run |
| Hotel search and filter | Monitor | SkyRoam Travel | Ticks free cancellation, sorts by price, reads every results page |
| Train seat availability | Monitor | IndiRail Express | Searches a route and class; records AVL / RAC / waitlist and fare per train |
| Activities and tours | Monitor | Explorely | Filters by category, sorts by price, reads every page of experiences |
| Hotel reviews watch | Monitor | StayVerdict | Sorts newest first, reads review pages, flags new and negative reviews |
| Travel advisory watch | Monitor | TravelSafe | Tracks advisory levels, summaries and visa rules per country |
| Competitor offers | Monitor | TripNova, SkyRoam | Reads holiday packages, prices, promotions and validity |
| Hotel pricing | Monitor | StayBay Hotels | Nightly rates and availability (the Goa page is redesigned every third day) |
| Campaign page | Monitor | SkyRoam campaigns | Headline, offer copy, CTA and placement |
| Partner updates | Monitor | PartnerHub | Supplier notices |
| Travel trends | Monitor | Wanderlytics | Destination demand index and events |
| Catalogue scan | Monitor | books.toscrape.com (real, public) | Opens a category and reads listings across pages (needs internet) |
| Custom steps | Either | Any allowlisted site | Your own JSON step list |
| Flight status (live) | Monitor | Aviationstack API (real data) | Calls the Aviationstack API instead of opening a page (no browser needed): records flight number, airline, status, estimated times, delay, terminal and gate for a route such as DEL to BOM, then compares with the last run |

### Demo websites

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000/mock** (or *Demo websites ↗* in the console sidebar) to browse all ten bundled sites
yourself: SkyRoam Travel, TripNova Holidays, StayBay Hotels, PartnerHub, Wanderlytics, IndiRail Express,
Explorely, StayVerdict and TravelSafe, plus SkyRoam campaign pages. Each has its own brand, a cookie
banner, realistic layouts and illustrations, and data that moves when you press *Move market forward a day*
on the dashboard, so repeated runs have real changes to detect. All brands, airlines, hotels, reviews
and advisories are fictional; nothing is charged. Illustrations are generated SVG, so everything works offline.

### Custom steps

```json
[
  {"tool": "navigate", "target": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mock/travel/hotels?city=jaipur", "purpose": "Open results"},
  {"tool": "dismiss_popups", "args": {"selectors": ["#accept-cookies"]}, "purpose": "Accept cookies"},
  {"tool": "select", "args": {"selector": "#sort", "value": "rating"}, "purpose": "Sort by rating"},
  {"tool": "paginate", "args": {"schema": "hotel_listings", "next_selector": ".pagination a.next", "max_pages": 2}, "purpose": "Read pages"}
]
```

Tools: `navigate, dismiss_popups, wait_for, click (selector or text), fill, select, check, uncheck,
press, scroll, extract, paginate, pick_best, capture, assert_text, screenshot, approval`.
Values can use `{{placeholders}}` from workflow inputs or earlier `capture` steps. To target another
website, add its hostname to `DOMAIN_ALLOWLIST` in `.env` after confirming its terms allow automation.

## Models and cost

The product works fully without an LLM: planning, extraction, comparison and summaries are
deterministic and grounded in extracted records. With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, the planner can add
risks and reprioritise URLs (restricted to whitelisted tools and task URLs; invalid output is
discarded) and the completion writer rewrites the headline and "why it matters". Numbers, evidence
and owners always come from data. Per-run model spend is tracked and shown on the dashboard.

## About the bundled sources

`mock_sources/` serves realistic competitor, hotel, campaign, partner and trend pages on the
service's own host, driven by a market clock. They exist so the platform can be demonstrated and
tested end to end without scraping third-party sites. Production sources are added through
`DOMAIN_ALLOWLIST` after source-governance approval; prefer partner/internal APIs where available.

## Troubleshooting on Windows

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `python` is not recognized | Reinstall Python and tick "Add python.exe to PATH", or install from the Microsoft Store |
| Live view says no frames / "Chromium is not installed" | Run `.venv\Scripts\python -m playwright install chromium` in this folder |
| Port 8000 already in use | Close the other server, or edit `start_windows.bat` and `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in `.env` to use 8010 |
| Windows Defender Firewall prompt | Allow on private networks; the server only listens on 127.0.0.1 |
| books.toscrape.com run fails | Needs internet access; corporate proxies may block it |
| Old runs look wrong after upgrading | Run `reset_data_windows.bat` (the database also migrates itself automatically) |

## Known limitations

- Only 3 browsers run at once by default (`MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`); the rest queue.
- The scheduler runs in-process; for multiple API replicas move it to a single worker or a queue
  (Celery/RQ/Arq) with a lock.
- Authentication uses static bearer tokens (plus an `x-role` header for the demo UI). Replace with
  SSO/JWT before exposing beyond an internal network.
- Snapshot retention is not yet pruned automatically; add a retention job per `browser_policy.md`.
- Vector memory (pgvector/Qdrant) is not required for the three core workflows and is not wired in;
  snapshots and records are stored relationally with stable entity keys for comparison.

## Live data: Aviationstack flight status

The **Flight status (live data)** workflow reads real flight data from the [Aviationstack](https://aviationstack.com) API instead of the bundled demo sites. It uses the `fetch_api` action, so no browser is started: the API answer is turned into records and goes through the same extraction, comparison, reasoning and completion steps as every other workflow.

**What it records:** flight number, airline, route, date, status, scheduled or estimated departure and arrival, departure delay in minutes, terminal and gate. This is flight *status*, not fares or availability.

**Setup**

1. Create a free key at aviationstack.com.
2. Set `AVIATIONSTACK_API_KEY` as an environment variable: in `.env` locally, or under *Environment* on Render. Never commit the key.
3. Add `api.aviationstack.com` to `DOMAIN_ALLOWLIST` (comma separated, no spaces).
4. Choose **Flight status (live data)** when creating a task and enter airport codes, for example `DEL` and `BOM`.

**Settings** (all optional except the key)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AVIATIONSTACK_API_KEY` | none | Required. Without it the run fails with a clear message; the mock sources still work. |
| `AVIATIONSTACK_MONTHLY_LIMIT` | 90 | Stops calling the API after this many requests in a month, to protect the free quota (about 100). |
| `AVIATIONSTACK_CACHE_TTL_MIN` | 60 | Identical queries inside this window are served from a local cache and cost no quota. |
| `AVIATIONSTACK_ALLOW_HTTP` | false | Allows plain HTTP if the plan refuses HTTPS. The key then travels unencrypted, so use it only for a demo key. |

**Good to know**

- The free plan allows roughly 100 requests a month. The request counter and cache live in the server's temporary folder, so they reset when Render redeploys; check the Aviationstack dashboard for the real count.
- Do not schedule this workflow more often than once a day on the free plan.
- Several flight numbers can be one physical flight (codeshares), so identical times and gates across airlines are normal.
- Times are shown as Aviationstack returns them (labelled `+00:00`); check against the airline before treating them as exact.
- Code: `backend/services/aviationstack.py` (client, cache, quota guard), the `fetch_api` action in `agents/browser_execution/runner.py`, the `flight_status` schema in `extraction/schemas`, and the workflow in `agents/planner/workflows.py`. Tests: `tests/functional_tests/test_aviationstack.py`.
